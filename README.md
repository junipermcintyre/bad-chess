# Bad Chess
This is literally just a poorly coded game of chess for two players.

It's just for brushing up on Python really.

It's not even done! Win conditions aren't written, knights & bishops & kings & queens can't even move.

## Install & Run
1. Clone
2. `python play.py`

## Notes
All the classes are in `/src`. The chess game has its own class (`src/chess.py`) and the pieces each have their own class (`src/[piece_name].py`). There's also a parent class for the pieces (`piece.py`).

Chances are this never gets completed of course.

## Documentation
Ha! I'm not writing any for this. Lol.
